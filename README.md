# sv_ld_shiny
Source code for an **[R Shiny app]**(https://smyan.shinyapps.io/sv_ld_shiny) to browse linkage disequilibrium between structural variants (SVs) and SNPs.

Data comes from Yan SM et al., [Local adaptation and archaic introgression shape global diversity at structural variant loci](https://elifesciences.org/articles/67615), (_eLife_ 2021).

SVs were discovered from long-read sequencing and genotyped in 2504 individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. SNP genotypes were taken from the [20190312 release](http://ata_collections/1000_genomes_project/release/20190312_biallelic_SNV_and_INDEL/) of SNP/indel genotypes called on GRCh38 by the 1KGP consortium.

Raw SV/SNP LD data is provided in `ld_filtered_20210114.txt.gz`.
